## Centeum Approach
Centeum does not use the original cryptocurrency approach, for example, Centeum is a non-transactionalble coin, how it works is that you mine a Centeum coin, then you would wait for the Centeum value to go up then sell the coin for a higher price.

This is a good way to earn money fast.

## Disclaimer
I am not promoting any financial subject n'or i am encouraging you to get the coin.
